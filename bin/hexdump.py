"""
usage: hexdump.py [-h] [-C]

show bytes as themselves, don't see them only as terminal control codes and character encodings

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -C          show hex and us-ascii

bugs:
  show UTF-8 emoji where they appear, unlike Bash "hexdump" holding to 1967 us-ascii
  acts like "hexdump -h" if called with no args, unlike Bash "hexdump"

examples:
  Oh no! No examples disclosed!! ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’” ðŸ’¥
