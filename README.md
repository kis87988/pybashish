# pybashish

Come here to read the unlicensed Python source code inside Bash

Take one source file and fork it, to meet your need instead

Tell us if "bin/echo.py" is most like what you expected

Tell us if "bin/grep.py" is least like what you expected

Stop settling for the points-of-view that Bash shoves on you, leftover from last century
