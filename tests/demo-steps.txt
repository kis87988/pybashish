# Let's say we need you to start speaking Python as fluently as I do

# How do I set you up?
# Well you be you, we'll have to tune this for you ... but many of you already know Bash
# Not all of Bash, just enough Bash to get your job done

# I can rewrite just those bits into Python, set you up to copy-edit
# Like our own Stack Overflow for Python, but executable, small, focused on us
